            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education is a procedure of learning where knowledge,
                skills, and habits move from one generation to the other. Moreover, education is essential
                for the overall development of a human being. For instance, their personal, social as well
                as the economic development of the country. If we talk about the importance of education
                in our daily life, we have to admit that it improves our personal lives and helps in
                running the societies smoothly by protecting everyone including ourselves from the
                harmful and unexpected events. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">When we see that children everywhere are required by law
                to go to school, that almost all schools are structured in the same way, and that our
                society goes to a great deal of trouble and expense to provide such schools, we naturally to
                assume that there must be some good, logical reason for all this. Perhaps if we didn't force
                children to go to school, or if schools operated much differently, children would not grow up to
                be competent adults. Perhaps some really smart people have figured all this out and have proven it
                in some way, or perhaps alternative ways of thinking about child development and education have
                been tested and have failed.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-small">Lets If we want to understand why standard schools are
                what they are, we have to abandon the idea that they are products of logical necessity
                or scientific insight. They are, instead, products of history. Schooling, as it exists today, only
                makes sense if we view it from a historical perspective. And so, as a first step toward explaining
                why schools are what they are, I present here, in a nutshell, an outline of the history of education,
                from
                the beginning of humankind until now. Most scholars of educational history would use different terms
                use here, but I doubt that they would deny the overall accuracy of the sketch. In fact, I have used
                the writings of such scholars to help me develop the sketch.</p>
